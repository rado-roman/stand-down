# Contributing

Thanks for helping make Stand-down better! We accept Issues and PRs for:
- Venue additions/updates in `cities/`
- Copy and asset improvements
- Organizer tips and checklists

## How to propose a change
1. Open an Issue first for non-trivial changes (use a template).
2. For small fixes, open a PR directly.
3. Keep PRs focused; include screenshots for asset changes.

## Style
- Clear, friendly, and concise English.
- Keep the vibe: no talks, no pitches.
- Prefer short lists and checkboxes over long prose.
