# Code of Conduct (Short)

We’re committed to a friendly, safe, and welcoming space for everyone. By joining Stand-down, you agree to:

- Be respectful; don’t harass or exclude anyone.
- Keep recruiting and sales *low‑key* and opt‑in.
- Ask consent before taking or sharing photos.
- Step away from debates that get heated; ping the host if something feels off.

**Unacceptable behavior** includes harassment, discrimination, sustained disruption, and any unwelcome attention.

**Reporting & enforcement**
- Tell the host on the night or email **<contact@email>**.
- Hosts may issue warnings or ask someone to leave to protect the vibe.
- Repeated or serious violations can lead to a chapter ban.

This CoC is intentionally short; chapters may link to a longer CoC if desired.
