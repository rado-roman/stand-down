# Stand-down @ <place>

A flexible, open-source **after‑work developer hang**. No talks. No pitches. Just devs hanging out midweek.

This repo contains everything you need to run a chapter in your city and propose improvements via Issues & Pull Requests.

## Quickstart
1. Pick a friendly pub and a consistent slot (default: Wednesdays, 18:00–20:30).
2. Create an RSVP page (Luma/Partiful/Meetup/etc.) and cap at ~24 for week one.
3. Print the table sign from `assets/table-sign.md`.
4. Host greets newcomers 18:00–18:30, introduces people, keeps the vibe chill.
5. File a quick retro using the **Event Retro** issue template and propose tweaks via PR.

## Chapters
Fork this repo, add `cities/<your-city>.md`, and open a PR. Keep the core vibe and Code of Conduct intact.
