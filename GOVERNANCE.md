# Governance

**Maintainers:** @rado-roman (Copenhagen).

**Decision model:** *Lazy consensus.* If no substantive objections within **72 hours**, a maintainer may merge. Trivial fixes may be merged immediately.

**Chapters**
- Name format: **Stand-down @ <place>** (e.g., Stand-down @ Nordvest Ølbar).
- Requirements:
  - Use this repo’s Code of Conduct.
  - Keep the “no talks, no pitches” format.
  - Publish venue basics in `cities/<city>.md`.
  - Attribute per `LICENSE`.

**Night roles**
- *Host (mandatory):* greets 18:00–18:30, introduces people, monitors CoC.
- *Guest host (optional):* designated backup.

**Retrospectives**
- After each event, open an **Event Retro** issue and capture headcount, what worked, and tweaks.

**Conflicts / brand protection**
- Maintainers may ask chapters to adjust or pause if they drift from the format or breach the CoC.
